The following code was used to to examine is the factors influecing total exam score for schools in California. The variables of interest were student-to-teacher ratio and computers per student. 

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)

library(SDSRegressionR)

#import data...
school <- read.csv("data/Caschool.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(school)
#View(school)
school$totalscore <- school$mathscr + school$readscr
school$computers20 <- school$compstu * 20
school$expnstuscale <- school$expnstu / 100
school$enrltotscale <- school$enrltot / 100

# Variable Statistics
vars <- c("totalscore", "elpct", "expnstuscale", "enrltotscale", "str", "computers20")   # first variable of interest should be repsonse variable
sapply(school[,vars], mean)
sapply(school[,vars], sd)

# Correlation Matrix
library(psych)
corr.test(school[,vars])$r

#Determine and run the final model
full <- lm(totalscore ~ elpct + expnstuscale + enrltotscale + str + computers20, data=school)

#Look for any issues:
library(car)
summary(full)
vif(full)
residFitted(full)
cooksPlot(full, key.variable = "ID", print.obs = TRUE, sort.obs=TRUE, save.cutoff = TRUE)
threeOuts(full, key.variable = "ID")

#Clean up
"%not in%" <- Negate("%in%")
good_school <- school[school$ID %not in% c("49"),] #You should complete this part...

#Re-run the final model
fullg <- lm(totalscore ~ elpct + expnstu + enrltot + str + computers20, data=good_school)

#Tag observations in the final model
good_school$in_fullg <- tagObs(fullg)
table(good_school$in_fullg)

#Keep just those in the model
#good_school_fullg <- good_school[which(good_school$in_fullg == 1), ]
#sum(good_school_fullg$in_fullg) 
#Don't need to run this since initial and final model have the same number of obs.

#Now for the Sequential Regression:
#Model 1:
m1_seq <- lm(totalscore ~ expnstuscale + elpct + enrltotscale, data=good_school)
summary(m1_seq)
summary(m1_seq)$r.squared
lmBeta(m1_seq)
pCorr(m1_seq)
confint(m1_seq)

#Model 2:
m2_seq <- lm(totalscore ~ expnstuscale + elpct + enrltotscale + str + computers20, data=good_school)
summary(m2_seq)
summary(m2_seq)$r.squared
lmBeta(m2_seq)
pCorr(m2_seq)
confint(m2_seq)

#Now the Sequential Results
anova(m1_seq, m2_seq)
summary(m2_seq)$r.squared - summary(m1_seq)$r.squared
              
good_school %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=elpct, y=totalscore)) + geom_smooth(aes(y=totalscore, x=elpct), method = lm, formula = y ~ x, se=TRUE)

# Manipulate this code
library(psych)
library(lsmeans)
describe(good_school$elpct)
hist(good_school$elpct)
pgr <- summary(lsmeans(m2_seq, "elpct", at=list(elpct=seq(0, 90, 3))))

schoolPlot <- simpleScatter(good_school, elpct, totalscore,
                            title="CA School", 
                            xlab="English Learner Percentage", ylab="Total Score")

schoolPlot + 
  geom_line(data=pgr, aes(x=elpct, y=lsmean), color="red") +
  geom_ribbon(data=pgr, aes(x=elpct, y=lsmean, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL), alpha=0.3)

```
